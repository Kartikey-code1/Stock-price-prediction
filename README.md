# Stock-price-prediction
This project is a full-stack machine learning workflow for stock market analysis. It fetches historical stock data, computes technical indicators (MA20, Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD), and predicts next-day stock prices using an LSTM model. The app features an interactive dashboard with charts and metrics for easy visualization.
